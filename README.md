# Uniflow

Uniflow is a Windows GUI Frontend for Emulation.


# Pourpus
The application serves as a comprehensive frontend for emulator management & game library organization.

# Compability
It's importent to know that This version is only working with xenia emulator at the moment, with more emulator support planed in the future.

# Development
It's developed using AutoIt for programming, with rendering handled by the Irrlicht 3D game engine through a plugin system. 

# History
It fetures a Windows-based graphical user interface that evolved from the FlowMii,WiiFlow and CEMUGUI projects. 
The project was originally led by TOSanthony, with my initial involvement as a graphic artist. Following TOSanthony's departure, I assumed the role of lead developer & undertook a significant rebuild of the project. After experiencing some data loss. Through a combination of programming experience and AI assistance, I've successfully restored the project to a functional state. While most core features are operational, a critical bug affecting the theme system currently prevents a full Functional application. because at the moment themes are not fully working properly. i personaly have limmeted programing skills my self so I'm hopeing The project will now gain new users & developers so that I may grow the project further in the programing sence. My time with the project has given me a chance to use my Grapic art's skills to create over 200+ themes for the project that you will see as the become avalible,
its save to say the project has all the grapics and art that it could ever need! but now the project needs Programers.
