# Uniflow

Uniflow is a Windows GUI Frontend for Emulation.

It fetures a Windows-based graphical user interface that evolved from the FlowMii,WiiFlow and CEMUGUI projects. The application serves as a comprehensive frontend for emulator management & game library organization.

It's developed using AutoIt for programming, with rendering handled by the Irrlicht 3D game engine through a plugin system. 

The project was originally led by TOSanthony, with my initial involvement as a graphic artist. Following TOSanthony's departure, I assumed the role of lead developer and undertook a significant rebuild of the project after experiencing data loss.
Current Status
Through a combination of programming experience and AI assistance, I've successfully restored the project to a functional state. While most core features are operational, a critical bug affecting the theme system currently prevents a full release.
Features
Working Components

Comprehensive game library management
Online scraper integration for game metadata
Local scraper functionality

Automatic emulator launch system

Theme System

175 themes completed
34 additional themes planned for post-launch update
Current development blocked by theme layer rendering bug
Theme display functionality requires resolution before release

Technical Challenges
The primary obstacle preventing release is a bug within the theme layer system that impacts proper theme rendering. Once this issue is resolved, the project will be prepared for public release with full theming capabilities.
